Payout timing
=============

Tezos rewards are paid out by the protocol at the end of a given cycle.

By default, TRD then distributes these rewards at the beginning of the next cycle.

TRD behavior is to pay out the last released payment cycle.

A cycle on mainnet lists 3 days.

Delegation takes 2 cycles to take effect. This is unlike staking, which is instantaneous.
