How to use the Tezos Signer
===========================

Tezos signer daemon can be configured to sign the
operations with the secret key of the account.
There are two steps, first import secret key to
the signer, second tell the client that it can use
particular signer to sign the operations.

1. Configure Signer
  Replace "`<myaddressalias>`" with your alias.
  Replace "edesk1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  with your encryped private key. IP address and port
  selection are up to the user.

  ::

      ./tezos-signer import secret key <myaddressalias> encrypted:edesk1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      ./tezos-signer launch socket signer -a 127.0.0.1 -p 22000 -W

2. Configure Client
  Replace "`<myaddressalias>`" with your alias.
  Replace "`<PKH>`" with your public key hash.
  Use the same host port combination from the previous step.

  ::

    ./tezos-client import secret key <myaddressalias> tcp://127.0.0.1:22000/<PKH> -f

When the client is required to sign an operation, the operation
is sent to the signer. Signer generates a signature and sends
back to the client. Normally encrypted accounts are imported
to the signer. So, it is necessary to provide encryption password
to the signer at launch. Note that signer generates generic
signatures e.g. sigXXXX but not edsigXXXX.
