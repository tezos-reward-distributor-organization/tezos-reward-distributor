How to configure Tezos Reward Distributor?
==========================================

Email Setup
------------------------

Various notifications, such as completed cycle payouts, can be delivered to you via email.
Please see docs/plugins.md for information on configuring this plugin.

Fee Setup
------------------------

fee.ini file contains details about transaction fees. Currently the fee
value specified under DEFAULT domain is used as fee amount. It is in
mutez.

Baker Configuration:
--------------------

Each baker has its own configuration and policy. A payment system should
be flexible enough to cover the needs of bakers. The application uses a yaml
file for loading baker specific configurations.

Configuration tool can be used to create baking configuration file
interactively. Also an example configuration file is present under
examples directory.
By default configuration files are kept under ~/pymnt/cfg directory.
Configuration directory can be changed with "-f" configuration option.
Name of a configuration file should be the baker's address
(e.g. tz1boot1pK9h2BVGXdyvfQSv8kd1LQM6H889.yaml).

You can use configure.py tool to interactively create your configuration
file, with ease.

Available configuration parameters are:

**baking_address**
  Address of the baker. It must be an implicit account (tz1).
  No alias is allowed.
  
**payment_address**
  This is the address where payments will be done from. A PKH
  or alias of implicit or originated account is accepted. For
  more information on the payment address configuration please
  refer to the next section.
  
**service_fee**
  A decimal in range [0-100]. Also known as the baker's fee.
  This is evaluated as a percentage value. Example: If set to 5,
  then 5% of baking rewards are kept as a service fee by the baker.

**founders_map**
  A dictionary of PKH and ratio (decimal in the range [0-1])
  pairs. Each item in this dictionary represents PKH of each
  founder and his ratio of the shares coming from the service fee.
  Implicit or originated addresses are accepted. It is important
  that the sum of all ratios equals to 1. This map is optional
  if founders do not want to be paid from service fees, in
  this case, service fee remains in baking balance.
  
  Example::

    service_fee: 10
    founders_map:
        tz3VxS7ff4YnZRs8b4mMP4WaMVpoQjuo1rjf: 0.6
        tz1PirboZKFVqkfE45hVLpkpXaZtLk3mqC17: 0.4
  
  Alice and Bob are both founders of Acme Bakery. Their bakery fee is 10%. 
  Alice has a 60% (0.6) interest in the bakery, and Bob has a 40% (0.4) interest. 
  When rewards are delivered at the end of each cycle, 10% is taken as the bakery 
  fee (ie: *service_fee*). That 10% is then divided between Alice and Bob according to their ratios.
  
**owners_map**
  A dictionary of PKH and ratio ( decimal in the range [0-1])
  pairs. Each item in this dictionary represents PKH of each
  balance owner and his ratio of the amount he owns in the
  total baking balance. Implicit or originated addresses are
  accepted. It is important that the sum of all ratios equals
  to 1. This map is optional if owners do not want to be paid
  for baking rewards, in this case, service fee remains in
  baking balance.
  
  Example::

    Current Baker Balance: 17,400 XTZ
    Total Delegations: 69,520 XTZ
    Total Staked: 86,920 XTZ

    service_fee: 9
    owners_map:
      tz1PV5g16m9hHMAVJ4Hx6NzzUHgksDnTLFcK: 0.4
      tz1PirboZKFVqkfE45hVLpkpXaZtLk3mqC17: 0.4
      tz1VxS7ff4YnZRs8b4mMP4WaMVpoQjuo1rjf: 0.2
  
  Charlie, and Dave, have each transfered 6,960 Tez to the baker address. Edwin has transfered 3,480 Tez. They are each partial owners of the baking balance. When rewards are delivered at the end of each cycle, 9% is taken as the bakery fee (ie: *service_fee*). That 9% is dispersed to any *founders*. If there are no founders, that 9% remains in the baker's balance.
  
  The baker address is technically a delegator to itself. Its share of rewards are part of the overall cycle rewards. Charlie, Dave, and Edwin divide the "baker address rewards" as per the ratios in *owners_map*. Additionally, owners are *not* subject to the *service_fee*.

**specials_map**
  A dictionary of PKH and fee (decimal in the range [0-100] )
  pairs. This dictionary can be used to set special service
  fee values for desired delegators.
  
**supporters_set**
  A set of PKH values. Each PKH represents a supporter of the
  baker. Supporters are not charged with a service fee. Founders
  and balance owners are natural supporters, they are not
  needed to be added.

**min_delegation_amt**
  A minimum delegation amount can be set here. If this value is set 
  to 10, 10 XTZ are required as minimum. It is important to define 
  what happens to the rewards of excluded delegates that are below 
  the minimum delegation balance in rules_map.
  
**reactivate_zeroed**
  True/False - If True, an account to be paid found with a 0 
  balance will be reactivated, incurring the necessary burn fee 
  and storage, and rewards will be sent. If False, any account 
  with a 0 balance will be skipped payment. This will be noted in 
  the CSV report.
  
**delegator_pays_xfer_fee**
  Default value is true. If set to false, the transfer fee for
  each payment is paid by the delegate. Otherwise, the transfer
  fee is deducted from the delegator reward.

**delegator_pays_ra_fee**
  True/False - Functions just like delegator_pays_xfer_fee, except refers 
  to the burn/reactivation fee. If True, the burn fee 
  is subtracted from the reward payment (ie: delegate pays). 
  If False, burn fee is paid for by baker. If reactivate_zeroed: True 
  and delegator_pays_ra_fee: True but the reward is smaller than the burn fee,
  their rewards will be ignored and will simply remain at the bakers address.

**rules_map**
  The rules_map is needed to redirect payments. A pre-defined source (left side) is 
  mindelegation. Pre-defined destinations (right side) are TOF = to founders balance, 
  TOB = to bakers balance and TOE = to everyone. Variable sources and destinations are 
  PKHs.
  
  Example:  
  rules_map:  
  PKH: TOF (redirects payment from PKH to TOF)  
  PHK: TOB (payment will be kept in the baking_address)  
  PKH: PKH (redirects payment from PKH to PKH)  
  mindelegation: TOE (mindelegation will be shared with everyone)  
  
**plugins**
  This section of the configuration file, along with 'enabled' noted in the example below,
  is required, even if you are not using any of the included plugins.

  Minimum configuration::
