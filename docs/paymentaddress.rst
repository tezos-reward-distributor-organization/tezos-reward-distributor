Payment Address
===============

TRD is designed to work as a linux service. It expects 
the usage of the Tezos signer for encrypted payment
accounts. Unencrypted payment accounts can be used
without tezos signer. If a payment account is encrypted
and not configured to be signed by tezos signer,
TRD will freeze.

An address can only be used for payments if it satisfies the
following criteria:

- Public key of the address must be revealed. See tezos command
  line interface on how to run reveal command on tezos client.
  If an address is registered as delegate, there is no need to
  run reveal command.

  ::

      ./tezos-client reveal key for <alias>

- Secret key of the address must be known. If the payment
  address is an implicit address (tz), its secret key must
  be imported. If payment address is an originated address
  (KT), secret key of the manager address must be imported.

- If secret key is encrypted, tezos-signer must be used to
  sign payments. For instructions on how to use signer,
  please refer to the next section.

- Use of unencrypted secret key is also possible. The
  unencrypted secret key can be obtained from tezbox
  web wallet. An unencrypted secret key can be imported
  to the client using the command: 

  ::

      ./tezos-client import secret key <alias> unencrypted:edskXXXXX

For more information about tezos command line interface please
refer to the official Tezos documentation_.
