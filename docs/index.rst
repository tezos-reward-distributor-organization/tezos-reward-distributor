What is Tezos Reward Distributor?
#################################

TRD is a software for distributing baking rewards with delegators. This
is not a script but a full scale application which can run in the
background all the time. It can track cycles and make payments. It does
not have to be used as a service, It can also be used interactively.

TRD supports complex payments, pays in batches, provides two back ends
for calculations: rpc and tzstats. It was developed and tested extensively by
the community. For more information, please check following Medium article_ and the source code which can be found in the following Github_ repo.

Funding
#######

TRD is an open source project and will stay like this. It is not funded
by any organization. A grant request is rejected by Tezos Foundation.
However, I will try to continue to enhance the software and support the
community.
