What is Tezos Reward Distributor?
------------------------------------------------

TRD is a software for distributing staking rewards of
delegators introduced in detail in this Medium article_.
This is not a script but a full scale application which
can continuously run in the background as a Linux service.
It can track cycles and make payments. However it does
not have to be used as a service, but it can also be
used interactively.

TRD supports complex payments, pays in batches, provides
two back ends for calculations: rpc and tzstats_.
Developed and tested extensively by the community and the
source code which can be found in the following Github_ repo.

**Important note:**

The terms_ of tzstats note that a license is needed for
the commercial use of the API!

Funding
------------------------

TRD is an open source project and will stay like this. It is not funded
by any organization. A grant request is rejected by Tezos Foundation.
However, I will try to continue to enhance the software and support the
community.
