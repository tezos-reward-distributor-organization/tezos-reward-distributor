What's TRD?
------------------------------------------------

TRD is an open-source software for distributing staking rewards from bakers to delegators introduced in detail in this Medium article_. This is not a python script but a full scale application which can continuously run in the background as a Linux service. However it does not have to be used as a service, but it can also be used interactively. The tool convinces with its simplicity and yet leaves no configuration wish unfulfilled. Whether frozen or unfrozen rewards, minimum delegation, or actual vs ideal rewards - the TRD covers just about all possible constellations. Furthermore, the tool supports complex payments, pays in batches, and provides three back ends for calculations: Tezos RPC, tzstats_ API and TzKT_ API. TRD is developed and tested extensively by the community and the source code which can be found in the following Github_ repo.

Who needs TRD?
------------------------------------------------

The TRD is needed by bakers. There are a few payout tools available in the Tezos ecosystem. However, the TRD is probably the most used open source payout tool by bakers. It ranges from small bakers with a couple of delegators to large bakers with more than thousand delegators. The maintainers strive to keep up with the growing Tezos ecosystem. This in turn enables TRD users to participate in the exploration of new business areas like baking for liquidity pools or DAOs.

What else do you need for TRD?
------------------------------------------------

There are currently the following options to run TRD:

    a. If you want to use RPC (not public RPC) for the reward calculation, you need a Tezos archive node. 
    b. If you want to use an provider (pRPC, tzstats, tzkt) for the reward calculation, but want to inject your own transactions, at least a Tezos rolling node is needed.
    c. If you want to use an provider (pRPC, tzstats, tzkt) for the reward calculation and don't want to inject your own transactions, only the Tezos signer is needed.

However, for all options the Tezos signer is needed.

**Provider notes:**

TZStats
-----------

The terms_ of tzstats note that a license is needed for the commercial use of their API:

    If you wish to use the Data in a manner that is primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation (such use, “Commercial Use”), Blockwatch requires that you enter into a separate commercial license agreement. Entering into a separate commercial license allows us to protect Blockwatch’s investment in the Data and to maintain the integrity of the Data.
    
    Please contact us at license@blockwatch.cc for more information about Commercial Uses of our Data.

TzKT
-----------

With PR232_ the backend of the Tezos Reward Distributor can be optionally `Powered by TzKT API`__ under the following terms:

    TzKT API is free for everyone and for both commercial and non-commercial usage.
    
    If your application or service uses the TzKT API in any forms: directly on frontend or indirectly on backend, you should mention that fact on your website or application by placing the label "Powered by TzKT API" with a direct link to tzkt.io.
