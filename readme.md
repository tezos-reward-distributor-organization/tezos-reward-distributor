## Tezos Reward Distributor : Run & Forget [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tezos-reward-distributor-organization/tezos-reward-distributor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tezos-reward-distributor-organization/tezos-reward-distributor)

TRD is a software for distributing staking rewards of delegators introduced in detail in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@huseyinabanox/tezos-reward-distributor-e6588c4d27e7). This is not a script but a full scale application which can continuously run in the background as a Linux service. It can track cycles and make payments. However it does not have to be used as a service, but it can also be used interactively.
The documentation can be found [here](https://tezos-reward-distributor-organization.github.io/tezos-reward-distributor/).

TRD supports complex payments, pays in batches, and provides three back ends for calculations: Tezos RPC, [tzstats API](https://tzstats.com/) and [TzKT API](https://api.tzkt.io/). TRD is developed and tested extensively by the community.

**Provider notes:**

### TZStats

The [terms and conditions](https://tzstats.com/terms) of tzstats note that a license is needed for the commercial use of the API!

> If you wish to use the Data in a manner that is primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation (such use, “Commercial Use”), KIDTSUNAMI requires that you enter into a separate commercial license agreement. Entering into a separate commercial license allows us to protect KIDTSUNAMI’s investment in the Data and to maintain the integrity of the Data.
>
> Please contact us at license@kidtsunami.com for more information about Commercial Uses of our Data.

### TzKt

With [#232](https://github.com/tezos-reward-distributor-organization/tezos-reward-distributor/pull/232) the backend of the Tezos Reward Distributor can be optionally [Powered by TzKT API](https://tzkt.io/) under the following terms:

> TzKT API is free for everyone and for both commercial and non-commercial usage.
>
> If your application or service uses the TzKT API in any forms: directly on frontend or indirectly on backend, you should mention that fact on your website or
> application by placing the label "Powered by TzKT API" with a direct link to tzkt.io.

## Requirements and Setup

Python 3 is required. You can use the following commands to install it.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
```

Download the application repository using git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tezos-reward-distributor-organization/tezos-reward-distributor
```

To install required modules, use pip with requirements.txt provided.

```bash
cd tezos-reward-distributor
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Regularly check and upgrade to the latest available version:

```bash
git fetch origin #fetches new branches
git status #see the changes
git pull
```

## Sample configuration

Before running the TRD, you need to configure it e.g by adding your staking address and payout process.
The configuration file should be included in the `~/pymnt/cfg/` directory by default. You can use the following command to copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
# create directory
mkdir -p ~/pymnt/cfg/
cp tezos-reward-distributor/examples/tz1boot1pK9h2BVGXdyvfQSv8kd1LQM6H889.yaml ~/pymnt/cfg/
nano ~/pymnt/cfg/tz1boot1pK9h2BVGXdyvfQSv8kd1LQM6H889.yaml
```

## How to Run

For a list of parameters, run:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --help
```

The most common use case is to run in **mainnet** and start to make payments for the latest released rewards or continue making payments from the cycle after the last payment was done.

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

TRD necessitates an interface to get provided with income and delegator data in order to perform the needed calculations.
The default provider is the public rpc node *mainnet.tezrpc.me*. However, it is possible to change the data provider with the flag -P rpc.
Please note that in this case, the default node would be localhost:8732. In order to change the node url for the provider, you can give the desired url 
under the flag -A followed with node_url:port (e.g. -P rpc -A 127.0.0.1:8733).
Please note that the node should be an archive node, and that the port should be the rpc port specified while launching the node.
